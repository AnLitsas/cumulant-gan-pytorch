## PyTorch implementation of Cumulant GAN

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Cumulant GAN model, as described in the original paper. The Cumulant GAN is an advanced Generative Adversarial Network designed to tackle a variety of challenges, including instability, mode collapse, and sample quality.

## This implementation includes three toy examples:

- GMM8 Dataset
- TMM6 Dataset
- Swiss roll dataset
